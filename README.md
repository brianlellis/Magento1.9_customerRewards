# Customer Reward Tokens  

## What does it do?  

Records order data for each customer and assigns them a token with which records an order summary of the following:

* A ref to the token record 
* Order ID
* Customer ID
* Items in the order

## Improvements TODO

### BED

* Abstraction/application of certain methods

### FED
* Look at symlink/fs_cmds to allow for asset delivery based on the view not a blanketed XML head injection
